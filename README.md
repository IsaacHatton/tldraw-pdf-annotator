## tldraw-pdf-annotator

Live at [https://pdfdraw.isaach.uk/](https://pdfdraw.isaach.uk/)

This tool is a slightly modified version of [https://tldraw.dev/examples/pdf-editor](https://tldraw.dev/examples/pdf-editor), and therefore uses TLDraw's SDK and all dependencies of that.

I also use a polyfill from [https://gist.github.com/lmammino/ef121da874a80d657379a1cd64bf8166](https://gist.github.com/lmammino/ef121da874a80d657379a1cd64bf8166) to resolve an issue with compatibility with older browsers.
